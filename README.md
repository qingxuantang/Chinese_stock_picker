### Ratio Calculator

The goal of a ratio calculator is to calculate the short-term solvency ratio (or debt ratio), and then use it as a stock-picking filter. That is to say, the better the short-term debt payment capacity a company has, the more probable it may continue or start an upper trend in the short term. The bigger the value, the better.

### Kelly Criterion

Money management strategy based on Kelly J. L.'s formula described in "A New Interpretation of Information Rate". The formula was adopted to gambling and stock market by Ed Thorp, et al., see: "The Kelly Criterion in Blackjack Sports Betting, and the Stock Market".
